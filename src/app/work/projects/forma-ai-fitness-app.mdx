- **Vercel AI SDK**: For AI-powered personalization and recommendations
- **NativeWind**: For styling and UI components
- **Python & Django**: For backend services and data processing

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time AI recommendations while maintaining app performance. This was addressed by optimizing the AI model's response time and implementing efficient state management. Another challenge was ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices, which was solved through careful UI component design and testing.

## Outcome

FORMA is currently in development and not yet available for public use. But it will be available soon. And I will be working on it as a side project.
